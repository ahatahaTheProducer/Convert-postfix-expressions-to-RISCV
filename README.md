# Convert-postfix-expressions-to-RISCV
the provided assembly file converts given postfix expressions and outputs a RISC-V machine code

In this project, we are implementing a GNU assembly language program that interprets a
single line of postfix expression involving decimal quantities and outputs the equivalent RISC-V 32-
bit machine language instructions.

In order to run the program
````
make
./postfix_translator
````
and then provide the postfix expression

Introduction to RISC-V

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V can be freely used for any
purpose, allowing hardware designers and software developers to create more customized and optimized
computing systems. In this project, you will be utilizing the RISC-V 32-bit ISA, focusing specifically
on I-type (Immediate) and R-type (Register) instructions, which are essential for performing arithmetic
and logical operations directly on the processor.


Technical Specifications

Your program should convert the postfix expressions to the corresponding RISC-V machine language
code. You must only use I-type and R-type instruction formats as outlined in the RISC-V user-level ISA
manual, which you can reference here: https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS295/assets/
notebooks/RISCV/RISCV_CARD.pdf. Additional resources on RISC-V programming can be found at:
